# Could You *Reasonably* Drive to a Gold Medal-Winning Brewery for Dinner Tonight?

By Ian Bell • Twitter: [Ian_Bellio](https://twitter.com/Ian_Bellio) • October 2020

Below is a map of all the American breweries that have won a Gold Medal for one of their beers from the Great American Beer Festival. I have added a blue 50-mile buffer, which is what I figure to be a *reasonable* distance to drive for some delicious **GOLD MEDAL** beer once in a while. Your mileage may vary. 

Click on each city below to find the local breweries that have won a gold. Locations are approximate.
